# Way of Working Report

Based on the Essence "Way-of-Working" checklist, our team is currently best characterised as being in the In Use state and moving toward In Place. We have established and reinforced shared principles and constraints through an initial meeting, where introductions, division of responsibilities, and agreement on coding guidelines/best practices took place. We then revisited these agreements in a follow-up meeting before the first merge to ensure the practices and tools were being applied consistently and to resolve misunderstandings. Finally we held a pre-delivery meeting to coordinate finishing work and reflect on how our current approach should carry into the next project. All-in-all, we believe this shows that the selected practices and tools are being used for real work, are inspected at regular intervals, and are being adapted to our context with explicit team support. The main obstacles to reaching the next states, In Place and Working well are that some parts of our way of working are not completely adopted and in sync across the whole team as "the normal way" of working (e.g.,coding and naming standards, small linting issues, and more systematic evidence that the approach is stabilising and enabling predictable progress). Additionally, more elapsed time and more retrospective analysis and continuous tuning is needed for the way of working to become routine, natural, and "working well."
