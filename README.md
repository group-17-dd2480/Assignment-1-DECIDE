# Assignment-1-DECIDE

## Goal
The goal of assignment #1 Download assignment #1is to implement a program according to the modern development techniques. To this extent, the grading focuses more on the software engineering part of the assignment than on the program, see the grading scheme below.

## Task
Each group has to implement the DECIDE program, whose specification is given here.

The task has been chosen because it is very appropriate for splitting the work and for unit testing.

You must use a development platform (Github, Bitbucket or KTH Github). Only the content published on the development platform is used for grading. The content means: 
1) the code 
2) the issues 
3) the pull requests 
4) the continuous integration data (e.g., from GitHub actions) if available. (Using automated builds and tests for CI is optional in this assignment.)

The students can start the task now, and have to be done at the final grading session for this assignment.

## Roles
Roles of the students: coordinate in the group, do the work, deliver on time, ask for feedback on the Canvas discussion forum.

Roles of the teaching assistants: provide support for students during laboratory exercise, on the Canvas discussion forum, prepare a first version of the grading form.

Roles of the lecturers: final assessment and official grading.

## Grading

The assignment is graded either "Pass" or "Pass with distinction".

It contributes to the final course grade according to the grading specification of the course.

By default all students of a group have the same grade. However, if there is unbalanced work, as reported by the student or detected by the teaching team, more qualified grading can be taken.

To get a Pass (every point must be achieved).

### Task list (mandatory tasks)

| Task | Achieved (Yes/no) | Optional comment |
|-----|------------------|------------------|
| **Property:** the repository is structured with appropriate folders and contains a good READMELinks to an external site.. In addition to the contents of a normal README, your README also contains the statement of contributions. <br><br> **Assessment:** The grader assesses the appropriateness of all top-level files and folders. The grader reads the README and the statement of contributions. | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Property:** the program should be functionally correct <br><br> **Assessment:** the students point to the three main test cases, and the TA assess the correctness of the contract and the oracles (expected value in assertion). The TA/grader may ask for looking at other test cases at random to further assess correctness. | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Property:** the program should be appropriately tested, with at least one unit test per LIC (if any input is valid), and at least two tests (including a positive test and a negative test with invalid inputs) if applicable. <br><br> **Assessment:** The grader will open a random sample of test cases (minimum 3), and assess whether: <br> • The contract that is tested is clearly formulated in natural language <br> • The assertions of the tests correctly and completely assess the contract | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Property:** the collaboration is well structured and traceable <br><br> **Assessment:** The grader will open the commit history on Github, and will select a minimum of 5 commits, at random, to check that: <br> • every commit is an atomic bug fix or feature, with a clear commit message. A prefix convention is appropriate, e.g., commit messages starting with "feat", "fix", "doc", "refactor"). <br> • the commit contents reflect the commit message, every bug fix or feature commit contains a test (i.e., adds at least one test or modifies at least one existing test). <br> • the commits are well balanced among group members <br> (Note that only the most recent second half of commits will be considered, so as to let students time to understand the process) | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Property:** You have assessed and documented (in one paragraph) your way of working (p. 58 in the Essence standardLinks to an external site. v1.2) by evaluating the checklist on p. 60: <br> In what state are you in? Why? What are obstacles to reach the next state? <br><br> **Assessment:** The grader will read your statement and assess whether it corresponds to an honest and accurate self-evaluation. | ❌ | ❌ |
